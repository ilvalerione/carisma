# Authorization

If you provide access to your application to your clients or large team of developers, you may wish to authorize certain requests. For example, perhaps only administrators may delete records of a specific resource. Thankfully, Carisma takes a simple approach to authorization that leverages many of the Laravel features you are already familiar with.
