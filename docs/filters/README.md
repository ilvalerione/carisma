# Filters

Carisma filters allow you to fully customize the underlying resource Eloquent query. For example, you may want to list of all your application's users sorted by their total lifetime revenue. Creating such a list may require you to join to additional tables and perform aggregate functions within the query. 

If it sounds complicated, don't worry this is exactly the type of situation filters are designed to solve.
