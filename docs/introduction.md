# Introduction

Carisma is a backend API automation framework for Laravel based applications. Of course, the primary feature of Carisma is the ability to administer your underlying database records using Eloquent by a RESTfull interface with the rest of the world. 

Carisma accomplishes this by allowing you to define a Carisma "resource" that corresponds to each Eloquent model in your application.
